# Find-nearby-Cabs
A Simple java program to find nearby cabs within a range of 10 KM using Great Circle Distance formula

## Design and implement a project as instructed below:
<ul>
<li> Create an input file which contains user_id, latitude, longitude, and name (cab driver) of
the cabs. </li>
<li> Obtain latitude and longitude of each cab along with user-id and name of the driver from 
the input file. </li>
<li>  Convert latitude and longitude of both the user and the cab present in degrees to radians.</li>
<li>  Calculate distance between the userâ€™s location and the cab using the Great Circle Distance
formula.</li>
<li> If the distance is found to be less than or equal to 10 km, then output the user-id and
name of the cab driver to a new file (output file) else take no action.</li>
 </ul>
 
 Distance can be calculated by Using Great-circle Distance Formula
